            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p> I'm Greg Manns, electrical and computer engineering student with a minor in computer science.<br> 
              While I was initially raised in Boston, a city with rich history and educational experience, my journey has taken me across various states- where I've picked up diverse experiences and perspectives.
              Texas's innovative enviroment and strategic importance to the areospace industry make it an ideal place for me to apply my skills and grow professionally.
              When I'm not studying or working on projects, you can find me exploring the outdoors, cooking new meals, or reading up on the latest tech innovations. 
           <br> Feel free to browse through my portfolio to learn more about my work and experiences. If you have any questions or would like to connect, don't hesitate to reach out!</p>
